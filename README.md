# Getting started
## Prerequisites
Before getting started install:
- Android SDK
- Java Development Kit

Make sure both are in Environment variables

## Running the app
After cloning this repository run  
`npm install`  
in project root directory. You only need to do this once after cloning, not everytime you want to run the app.  
Connect your mobile phone via USB.  
Allow USB-Debugging in your phone's settings.  
Run `npx expo run:android` in terminal.  
It can take some time for the app to build and after it shows that build was successful, the app should automatically open in your phone.
